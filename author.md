## Personal Experience

During college, I self-taught various programming languages and technology stacks, such as Java backend, frontend, and mini-program development. As the head of a studio, I led the construction of **dozens** of websites, won the national scholarship with **first place** in my major, won **national awards** and Shanghai **first prizes** in the Challenge Cup academic competition, received the Shanghai Outstanding Graduate award, and was named University Annual Figure. In my junior year, I published a textbook on "Blockchain Smart Contract Technology and Applications" and had internships at three companies: a fintech company, **ByteDance**, and **Tencent**.

During campus recruitment, I received offers from multiple large companies and ultimately converted to full-time at Tencent with the **top score** in my group, receiving the **SSP highest level** offer.

During my nearly 4 years at Tencent, I independently led BI project development and big data development, won the **championship** in Tencent's internal application development competition, and received the **5-star excellent employee** award. I also served as a mentor for new employees.

Most of my time was spent on work and content creation. Knowledge sharing is my hobby, and I want to leave something useful for everyone.
